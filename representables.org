A Simple Plan for representables.

1. Yoneda embedding on objects: define (Yo A).ob B = Hom B A
2. Yoneda Lemma:
   For any presheaf P and object A,

   there is a bijection between P A and Yo A -> P

3. Simple Representability: Fix presheaf P, object A. The following data are equivalent
   1. Yo A isomorphic to P
   2. um ∈ P A and (not needed to be natural?) function I : P -> Yo A st I and um are an isomorphism.

   The important part is that the naturality in the 2nd part is uniquely determined by the rest.
   
4. Parameterized Representability: Fix a profunctor R : C^o x D -> Set
   and a function on objects G₀ : D₀ → C₀. The following are equivalent
   1. G₀ extends to a functor G with C[ c , Gd ] ≡ R [ c , d ] natural in c^o x d.
   2. For every d ∈ D₀. Yo (G₀ d) isomorphic to R [-, d ]
   3. For every d ∈ D₀. um(d) ∈ R[ G₀ d , d ] and forall c, I : R[c , d] → C[ c , G₀ d ] s.t isomorphism

5. Yoneda is a functor and the yoneda lemma isomorphism is natural. By 4,

   Take G₀ = Yo : (C^o)₀ → (Psh(C)^o)₀
   Take R : Psh(C) × C^o → Set := R P A = P A (obviously this is a functor)

   Extending Yo to a functor with natural iso (Yo A) → P ≡ P A natural in P and A is equivalent by 4 to
   constructing for every A ∈ C.
   1. um(A) ∈ Yo A A = Hom(A,A) = id
   2. I : P(A) -> Psh(C)(Yo A, P)
